### Patch Changes

- [#1071](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/1071) [`ea9c077`](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/commit/ea9c07724bd6992480238a699fbb18835eab743e) - fix: publish internal dependency ranges as `^x.y.z` instead of exact pins

  Internal dependencies on other TanStack AI packages used `workspace:*` in
  `dependencies` and `peerDependencies`. pnpm rewrites that to an **exact** version
  at publish time, so a released package asked for e.g. `@tanstack/ai-utils@0.4.0`
  rather than `^0.4.0`.

  Two consequences for consumers:
  - **Duplicate copies.** An exact pin cannot dedupe. Installing a newer
    `@tanstack/ai` alongside a package pinned to the previous patch produced two
    copies in the tree, which breaks `instanceof` checks and module-level state,
    and inflates bundles.
  - **Unsatisfiable peers.** An exactly pinned `peerDependency` conflicts the
    moment the internal package ships its next patch, forcing consumers into
    overrides or `--legacy-peer-deps`.

  These fields now use `workspace:^`, which publishes as `^x.y.z`. Every package
  here is still `0.x`, so `^0.43.1` resolves to `0.43.x` only — patches dedupe
  cleanly and no breaking minor is ever pulled in.

  `devDependencies` deliberately keep `workspace:*`: they are never published, and
  `*` correctly means "always build against the local copy".
