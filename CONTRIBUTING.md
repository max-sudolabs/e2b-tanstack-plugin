# Contributing to TanStack AI

Thanks for contributing! This guide covers everything you need to get from a fresh clone to a merged PR.

## Before you start

- Search the [open and closed issues](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and [open and closed pull requests](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pulls?q=is%3Apr) before starting work to avoid duplicating an existing report or contribution.
- Keep each pull request focused on one change or topic. Pull requests that combine unrelated changes will be closed with a request to split them into separately reviewable contributions.
- Every pull request must follow the [TanStack AI pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md). Write a concise description that clearly explains what changed and why, and complete the template without removing or bypassing its required sections.
- You may use AI tools to help generate code, but you remain responsible for understanding, testing, and verifying every submitted change. Do not submit unreviewed, low-quality, or irrelevant generated code.
- Do not mass-submit unrelated or low-quality AI-generated pull requests. We treat that behavior as spam and may close the pull requests, block the contributor, and report the GitHub account.

## Prerequisites

- **pnpm**: 11.9.0 or newer. Use the version pinned in `packageManager` (`pnpm@11.9.0`).
  - Recommended: install via [Corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html). Run `corepack enable` once and pnpm is managed automatically.
- **Git**.

## Initial setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TanStack/ai.git
cd ai
pnpm install
pnpm run build:all   # build all public packages once so workspace deps resolve
```

`pnpm install` runs Playwright's chromium download (used by the E2E suite). If you don't need E2E, you can skip it via `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 pnpm install`.

## Repository layout

```
packages/    # Public, published packages (@tanstack/ai, @tanstack/ai-openai, etc.)
testing/                # Internal test harnesses — NOT published
  e2e/                  # Playwright + aimock E2E suite (mandatory coverage for all changes)
  panel/                # Stream processor visualisation panel
examples/               # Example apps (React, Solid, Vue, Svelte, vanilla)
codemods/               # Internal codemods (not published)
docs/                   # Documentation source
scripts/                # Repo-level scripts (doc generation, model sync, link verification, maintainer sweep)
agent-scripts/          # Repo GitHub agents (PR review bot)
```

- Direct children of `packages/` are public packages (published to npm).
- Everything under `examples/`, `testing/`, and `codemods/` is `"private": true` and excluded from build/publish.
- The build system is **Nx** with affected-target detection.
- The package manager is **pnpm** with workspace + catalog protocols.

For deeper architecture details (adapter system, isomorphic tools, framework integrations), see `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root.

## Syncing model metadata

`pnpm generate:models` is the maintainer command behind the daily **Sync Model Metadata** workflow (branch `automated/sync-models`). It:

1. Fetches OpenRouter, Vercel AI Gateway, and Lovable AI Gateway catalogs.
2. Regenerates `packages/ai-openrouter/src/model-meta.ts` and the Vercel Gateway model list.
3. Inserts **new** native-provider models into `packages/ai-openai`, `ai-anthropic`, `ai-gemini`, and `ai-grok`.
4. Writes a patch changeset for the packages that changed.

Rules the generator follows:

- Keep OpenRouter routing aliases (ids that start with `~`) in the OpenRouter catalog. Users can pass `chat({ model: '~anthropic/claude-haiku-latest' })`. The generated constant name maps `~` to `_`.
- Do **not** copy those aliases into native provider files (`ai-openai`, `ai-anthropic`, `ai-gemini`, `ai-grok`). Those adapters only accept the provider's own ids.
- For a new native-provider model, write id, modalities, and pricing. Infer features from OpenRouter `supported_parameters` when that field exists. Do **not** copy another model's tool list (`computer_use`, `google_search`, `x_search`, and similar).
- Anthropic first-party ids use dashes (`claude-fable-5-1`). OpenRouter uses dots (`claude-fable-5.1`). The generator hyphenates Anthropic ids on insert. Do not copy the dotted OpenRouter slug into `ai-anthropic`.
- Write a row in the provider's `*ChatModelToolCapabilitiesByName` map for every new chat model, even when `supports.tools` is still `[]`. Missing that row makes `ResolveToolCapabilities` fall back to `readonly []`.
- For new Anthropic models, infer the provider-options mix from the catalog: no sampling parameters → `AnthropicMaxTokensOptions`; `reasoning.mandatory` → `AnthropicAdaptiveOnlyThinkingOptions` plus `AnthropicOutputConfigOptions`.
- Leave curated tools and flags on existing models alone. Edit those by hand after the sync PR opens.

Do not rebase or hand-edit `automated/sync-models`. The next scheduled run force-pushes that branch from `main`. Merge generator fixes to `main` first, then let the workflow rebuild the sync PR.

## Adapter coverage file

`adapter-coverage.json` at the repo root lists every adapter's activities and models. tanstack.com fetches it at request time for the AI coverage page, so it must match the packages. `pnpm generate:coverage` rebuilds it from the adapter factories each package exports (`openaiText`, `falSpeech`), the model lists in its `model-meta.ts`, and the `docs/adapters/*.md` titles, and `test:coverage-json` fails CI when the committed file is stale or a new export cannot be classified.

Run it after any change to a `model-meta.ts`, and add new list exports to `SUFFIX_ACTIVITIES` or `IGNORED_EXPORTS` in `scripts/generate-coverage.ts` when the test asks for it.

The workflow pushes with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so GitHub does not start Test / E2E on that push. After a sync, a maintainer with write access can run the PR checks from the Actions tab, or push an empty commit to `automated/sync-models`.

## Day-to-day commands

All commands are run from the repo root. Nx handles affected detection and caching.

| Goal                          | Command             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Run unit tests (affected)     | `pnpm test:lib`     |
| Watch unit tests              | `pnpm test:lib:dev` |
| Type-check (affected)         | `pnpm test:types`   |
| Lint (affected)               | `pnpm test:eslint`  |
| Verify build artifacts        | `pnpm test:build`   |
| Format the repo               | `pnpm format`       |
| Build (affected)              | `pnpm build`        |
| Build everything              | `pnpm build:all`    |
| Run the full CI suite locally | `pnpm test`         |
| Run the affected-PR check     | `pnpm test:pr`      |
| E2E suite                     | `pnpm test:e2e`     |
| E2E with Playwright UI        | `pnpm test:e2e:ui`  |

Working on a single package? `cd packages/<pkg>` and use its scripts directly (`pnpm test:lib`, `pnpm test:types`, etc.).

## TypeScript configuration

There is a single `tsconfig.base.json` at the repo root with the shared `compilerOptions`. Every package extends it and overrides only what's unique to that package (e.g. `outDir`, JSX runtime, framework lib).

The standardised per-package shape is:

```jsonc
{
  "extends": "../../../tsconfig.base.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "dist",
    // + package-specific overrides only
  },
  "include": ["src", "tests"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "dist"],
}
```

Tests are included in typecheck. `vite.config.ts` / `vitest.config.ts` are not — they're tooling configs typechecked by the build tools themselves.

## Adding a unit test

- Place tests under `packages/<pkg>/tests/` with the suffix `.test.ts` (or `.test.tsx` for JSX).
- Vitest's defaults discover anything matching `**/*.{test,spec}.?(c|m)[jt]s?(x)` — no per-package config is needed.
- Tests are typechecked by `tsc` and linted by ESLint.

## Adding E2E test coverage (required)

**Every feature, bug fix, or behaviour change MUST have E2E coverage.** See `testing/e2e/README.md` for the full guide. Quick reference:

| Change type                            | What to add                                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| New provider adapter                   | Add provider to `feature-support.ts` + `test-matrix.ts`. Tests auto-run. |
| New feature (e.g. new generation type) | Add to types, feature config, support matrix, fixture, spec file.        |
| Chat / streaming bug fix               | Test case in `chat.spec.ts` or `tools-test/`.                            |
| Tool system change                     | Scenario in `tools-test-scenarios.ts` + spec.                            |
| Middleware change                      | Test in `middleware.spec.ts`.                                            |
| Client-side change (useChat etc.)      | Test covering the observable behavior change.                            |

Run the suite locally with `pnpm test:e2e`. Record real LLM fixtures with `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... pnpm --filter @tanstack/ai-e2e record`.

## Documentation (required when relevant)

If the change is user-facing, update `docs/` in the same PR. Do not ship the code now and the docs later.

User-facing means a caller can see or do something new or different:

- New or changed public API (exports, types, flags, env vars)
- New or changed behaviour
- New adapter capability
- Changed defaults, errors, or documented contracts

Skip docs only when nothing user-facing changed (CI, internal tests, same-behaviour refactors, agent files). Write that reason in the PR body.

## Changesets (required on the PR)

Any PR that changes a published package MUST include a changeset file on that PR. Run this before you open the PR:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Pick the affected packages and the bump type:

- **patch**: bug fix, internal refactor, perf, docs in package, no API change.
- **minor**: new public API, new opt-in behaviour, backwards-compatible enhancement.
- **major**: breaking change to a published API surface. Coordinate with maintainers first.

Do not add the changeset after review as a follow-up. It belongs in the first push of the PR.

Skip a changeset only when the PR does not change published packages (docs, CI, examples, testing, contributing). Tick the docs/CI/dev-only box on the PR template.

The defensive `ignore` list in `.changeset/config.json` blocks accidental publication from examples/testing/codemods even if `"private": true` is ever dropped.

## Branches and commits

- Branch off `main`. Name the branch after the change (`fix/openai-streaming-eof`, `feat/anthropic-cache-control`).
- Conventional Commits aren't strictly enforced, but follow the prefixes you see in `git log`: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `ci:`.
- Keep commits logical. The repo prefers a few coherent commits over one giant squash.

## Pull request flow

1. Push your branch and open a PR against `main`.
2. Fill the PR template. Tick **docs** and **changeset** honestly, or say why you skipped them.
3. CI runs: `pnpm test:pr` (sherif workspace check, knip dead-code, docs link verification, ESLint, unit tests, typecheck, build artifacts, build) + the full E2E suite.
4. Address review comments.
5. A maintainer merges. Releases are cut via Changesets. Your changeset entry lands in the next release.

### Automated Grok review

A Grok agent comments on open, non-draft PRs. The first lines of that comment say it is automated. It is not a maintainer review.

The bot sets exactly one of these labels:

- `ai-rejected` — the change is not useful, or it does not fix the claimed bug.
- `ai-needs-work` — the review listed fixes, but they are not on the branch yet (often a fork with maintainer edits off).
- `ai-ready` — the bot thinks a maintainer can merge after they Approve.

The bot never GitHub-approves and never merges. The `ready-to-merge` label still means a human approval plus green CI.

If the bot pushes, it only commits bugs and suggestions the review listed. Maintainers start a new run with a `/ai-review` comment, or from Actions (`workflow_dispatch`).

## Adding a new provider adapter

The pattern lives in `packages/ai-openai/`, `packages/ai-anthropic/`, `packages/ai-gemini/`, etc. New core adapters typically:

1. Create `packages/ai-<provider>/` with `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/`, `tests/`, `README.md`. Copy structure from an existing adapter. The README must start with the TanStack AI `<picture>` banner from `packages/ai/README.md` (`https://tanstack.com/api/readme/ai.png`). Do not use `media/header_ai.png`.
2. Implement tree-shakeable adapter exports under `src/adapters/` (`text.ts`, `embed.ts`, `summarize.ts`, etc.).
3. Add `model-meta.ts` so per-model type safety works.
4. Wire the provider into `testing/e2e/feature-support.ts` and `testing/e2e/test-matrix.ts`. Existing provider-coverage tests pick it up automatically.
5. Record fixtures (`OPENAI_API_KEY=... pnpm --filter @tanstack/ai-e2e record`) — or write deterministic ones by hand. **No real API keys at test time.**
6. Update `docs/` for the adapter, and add a `pnpm changeset` entry on the same PR.

If you're building a community/third-party adapter that lives outside this repo, follow `docs/community-adapters/guide.md` instead.

## Known gaps

- **Vue/Svelte SFCs are not currently linted.** Our linter doesn't yet support `.vue`/`.svelte` parsers in the toolchain we use; the script blocks inside those files rely on TypeScript and tests for safety. If you're touching a `.svelte` or `.vue` file, lean on `tsc` / `svelte-check` / `vue-tsc` and explicit tests.
- **Build configs (`vite.config.ts`, `vitest.config.ts`) are not in the `tsc` typecheck pass.** They're typechecked at build time by vite/vitest themselves. If you make changes there, run `pnpm build` or `pnpm test:lib` to surface issues.

## Reporting issues / getting help

- Bugs: first search the [open and closed issues](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/issues?q=is%3Aissue), then use the [bug report template](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) with a minimal reproduction if the bug has not already been reported.
- Questions / discussions: [TanStack Discord](https://tlinz.com/discord).
- Security: follow the disclosure process in `SECURITY.md` (if applicable) or email the maintainers directly.
